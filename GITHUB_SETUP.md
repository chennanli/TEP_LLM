# GitHub Setup Instructions

I've prepared two scripts to help you commit this project to GitHub:

## Step 1: Initialize Local Git Repository

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to this directory:
   ```
   cd /Users/chennanli/Desktop/LLM_Project/TE
   ```
3. Make the setup script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x setup_git_repo.sh
   ```
4. Run the setup script:
   ```
   ./setup_git_repo.sh
   ```

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner, then select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "LLM-TEP-Simulator")
4. Add an optional description
5. Choose visibility (Public or Private)
6. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license as you already have your files
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Push to GitHub

1. Make the push script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x push_to_github.sh
   ```
2. Run the push script with your GitHub username and repository name:
   ```
   ./push_to_github.sh YOUR_USERNAME YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and the repository name you created.

## Done!

Your code should now be on GitHub. Visit `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` to see it.

## Notes

- I've created a `.gitignore` file that excludes personal tokens, virtual environments, and other files that shouldn't be in version control.
- I've also created a `requirements.txt` file with the dependencies needed for this project.
