# 🚨 Repository Size Problem - SOLVED!

## 🔍 **Problem Identified:**
Your repository is **6.9GB** because of a **6.6GB tar.gz file** that was accidentally committed:
```
docs/Academic_materials/tep-manipulations.tar.gz.download/tep-manipulations.tar.gz
```

## ✅ **Immediate Fix Applied:**
1. **Removed large file from tracking:** `git rm --cached`
2. **Updated .gitignore** to prevent future large archives
3. **Committed the removal**

## 🎯 **Two Options to Complete the Fix:**

### **Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)**
**Create a fresh repository without the large file history:**

```bash
# 1. Create a new branch without the large file
git checkout --orphan clean-main

# 2. Add all current files (large file already removed)
git add .

# 3. Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - clean repository without large files"

# 4. Replace main branch
git branch -D main
git branch -m main

# 5. Force push to GitHub (this will overwrite history)
git push -f origin main
```

### **Option 2: Keep History (More Complex)**
**Use BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove large file from history:**

```bash
# Install BFG (if not installed)
brew install bfg

# Clean the large file from history
bfg --delete-files "tep-manipulations.tar.gz" .git

# Clean up
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Force push
git push -f origin main
```

## 📋 **Updated .gitignore (Already Applied):**
Added these patterns to prevent future issues:
```
# Large archive files
*.tar.gz
*.zip
*.rar
*.7z
*.tar
*.gz
```

## 🎯 **Recommendation:**
**Use Option 1 (Fresh Repository)** because:
- ✅ **Simplest and fastest**
- ✅ **Guaranteed to work**
- ✅ **Clean history**
- ✅ **No complex tools needed**

The large file was just academic material - losing that history won't affect your TEP simulator project.

## 🚀 **After Fix - Expected Results:**
- **Repository size:** ~10-50MB (normal for code project)
- **Push time:** Fast (seconds, not timeouts)
- **Clean history:** No large file artifacts

## ⚠️ **Prevention for Future:**
Your updated .gitignore now prevents:
- ✅ Large archive files (*.tar.gz, *.zip, etc.)
- ✅ Virtual environments (tep_env/)
- ✅ Data files (*.csv, *.png, etc.)
- ✅ Build artifacts and secrets

**Run Option 1 commands to get a clean, fast repository!** 🎛️✨
