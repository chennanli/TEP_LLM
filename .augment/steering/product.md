# Product Context - TEP Industrial Intelligence Platform

## 🎯 **Product Purpose**
Transform fragmented industrial monitoring tools into a unified, AI-powered platform for chemical process fault detection and optimization, starting with the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP).

## 👥 **Target Users**
- **Process Engineers** (Primary) - Optimize plant performance, diagnose complex faults
- **Plant Operators** (Primary) - Monitor real-time status, respond to alarms
- **Maintenance Engineers** (Primary) - Predict failures, minimize downtime
- **Plant Managers** (Secondary) - Performance dashboards and KPI tracking

## 🏭 **Business Context**
Industrial chemical plants lose millions annually due to:
- **Delayed fault detection** - Average 15-30 minutes to identify issues
- **Poor root cause analysis** - 60% of faults require expert consultation
- **Fragmented tools** - Operators use 5-8 different interfaces
- **Reactive maintenance** - 80% of maintenance is unplanned

## 🎯 **Key Success Metrics**
- **MTTD (Mean Time to Detection)** < 5 minutes (currently 15-30 min)
- **MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution)** < 30 minutes (currently 2-4 hours)
- **False Positive Rate** < 5% (industry standard 15-20%)
- **User Adoption** > 80% of plant operators

## 🚀 **Core Value Propositions**
1. **Unified Interface** - Single dashboard replaces 5-8 separate tools
2. **AI-Powered Diagnosis** - Multi-LLM analysis with chemical engineering context
3. **Real-time Intelligence** - 3-second data updates with instant anomaly detection
4. **Predictive Maintenance** - Historical pattern analysis prevents failures
5. **Scalable Architecture** - Easy deployment across multiple plants

## 🎛️ **Critical Features (MVP)**
- **Real-time Process Monitoring** - Live TEP simulation with 52 variables
- **Anomaly Detection** - PCA-based fault detection with visual indicators
- **AI Root Cause Analysis** - Multi-LLM (Claude, Gemini, Local) explanations
- **Process Control** - Parameter adjustment and fault injection
- **Historical Analysis** - Fault pattern tracking and trend analysis

## 🔮 **Future Vision**
- **RAG-Enhanced Analysis** - Chemical engineering knowledge base integration
- **Multi-Plant Support** - Configurable for different industrial processes
- **Advanced Optimization** - Process control recommendations
- **Industrial Database Integration** - TDengine, InfluxDB, Snowflake connectivity
- **Real Plant Connectivity** - OPC-UA, Modbus integration

## 💰 **Business Impact**
- **Cost Savings** - $2-5M annually per plant through faster fault resolution
- **Efficiency Gains** - 25-40% reduction in unplanned downtime
- **Safety Improvements** - Early fault detection prevents hazardous conditions
- **Knowledge Retention** - AI captures and shares expert knowledge

## 🎯 **Technical Decision Context**
All technical choices should prioritize:
1. **Reliability** - Industrial systems require 99.9% uptime
2. **Real-time Performance** - Sub-second response times for safety-critical alerts
3. **Scalability** - Support 1000+ concurrent sensor readings
4. **Maintainability** - Clear separation of concerns for long-term support
5. **Security** - Industrial network compliance and data protection

## 🔍 **Competitive Advantage**
- **AI-First Approach** - Unlike traditional SCADA systems
- **Chemical Engineering Context** - Domain-specific knowledge integration
- **Open Architecture** - Not locked to single vendor ecosystem
- **Modern Tech Stack** - React, FastAPI, containerized deployment
- **Cost-Effective** - 70% lower cost than enterprise solutions

## 📊 **Success Criteria**
- **Technical** - 99.9% uptime, <2s response time, 95% fault detection accuracy
- **Business** - 50% reduction in MTTD, 30% reduction in MTTR
- **User** - 80% adoption rate, 4.5/5 user satisfaction score
- **Operational** - 90% reduction in false alarms, 60% faster training time

This product context should guide all technical decisions, ensuring every feature serves the core mission of transforming industrial process monitoring through AI-powered intelligence.
