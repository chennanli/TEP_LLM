## 🎯 Current Sprint Planning

### **Sprint 1: Foundation Fixes (This Week)**

#### **Story 1: Anomaly Score Visibility**
**As a** process operator  
**I want** to see the anomaly score in real-time  
**So that** I know when the system detects problems

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given the dashboard is running, when I look at the plots, then I see anomaly score chart
- [ ] Given anomaly score > 3.0, when I look at the display, then I see red warning indicator
- [ ] Given normal conditions, when I monitor the score, then I see green normal indicator

**Technical Tasks:**
- [ ] Add 5th subplot for anomaly score time series
- [ ] Implement color-coded threshold zones
- [ ] Add current score display in status panel
- [ ] Update plot layout to accommodate new chart

#### **Story 2: Stable Baseline Understanding**
**As a** new user  
**I want** to understand normal operating conditions  
**So that** I can recognize when something is wrong

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given dashboard startup, when I view the system, then I see "STABLE" indicator
- [ ] Given stable conditions, when I look at values, then I see normal ranges displayed
- [ ] Given parameter changes, when values return to normal, then stability indicator returns

**Technical Tasks:**
- [ ] Define stable operating ranges for all variables
- [ ] Implement stability detection algorithm
- [ ] Add visual stability indicator
- [ ] Set appropriate default starting conditions

#### **Story 3: Control Guidance**
**As a** system operator  
**I want** to understand what each control does  
**So that** I can use the system effectively

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given any control, when I hover/focus on it, then I see explanation tooltip
- [ ] Given control explanations, when I read them, then I understand expected effects
- [ ] Given fault injection, when I select a fault, then I see description of symptoms

**Technical Tasks:**
- [ ] Add tooltips to all controls
- [ ] Create fault description database
- [ ] Implement dynamic help text
- [ ] Add expected effect ranges for each control

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **Testing Pyramid:**
```
        /\
       /  \
      / E2E \     ← Few, high-value end-to-end tests
     /______\
    /        \
   / Integration \  ← Medium number of integration tests
  /______________\
 /                \
