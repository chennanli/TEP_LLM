# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

The primary goal of the TEP Multi-LLM FaultExplainer is to create an intelligent, chemical engineering-aware fault diagnosis system that leverages multiple Large Language Models to provide comprehensive, contextual, and safety-prioritized analysis of Tennessee Eastman Process faults.

### Primary Goals:
1. **Chemical Engineering Excellence**: Integrate validated chemical component identification (92% confidence) and EO/EG process knowledge to provide scientifically accurate fault analysis.

2. **Multi-LLM Intelligence**: Implement Google Gemini, Local LMStudio, and comparison frameworks to provide diverse perspectives on fault diagnosis with confidence scoring.

3. **Safety-First Prioritization**: Implement chemical hazard-aware fault classification (P1-P5) that prioritizes safety-critical components (EO toxicity, acetylene explosivity, oxygen fire risk).

4. **Industrial Relevance**: Build upon 30+ years of TEP research with 85% literature validation to ensure practical applicability to real petrochemical operations.

## Background Context

The Tennessee Eastman Process represents one of the most challenging and realistic industrial process control benchmarks, but traditional fault detection methods lack chemical engineering context and safety awareness.

### Technical Context:
- **Chemical Foundation Established**: TEP definitively identified as Ethylene Oxide/Ethylene Glycol production (92% confidence)
- **Component Validation Complete**: 8 components validated against thermodynamic properties and literature
- **Safety Framework Defined**: Critical components identified (EO, acetylene, oxygen) with appropriate hazard classifications
- **Literature Validated**: 85% agreement with established research benchmarks from Chiang, Russell & Braatz and others

### Industrial Context:
- **Real Process Representation**: EO/EG production is a multi-billion dollar industry with significant safety challenges
- **Safety Critical Operations**: EO handling requires continuous monitoring due to toxicity, explosivity, and carcinogenic properties
- **Complex Fault Propagation**: Chemical reactions create interdependent fault scenarios requiring intelligent analysis
- **Economic Impact**: Process optimization and fault prevention have major economic implications

### Research Context:
- **Established Benchmark**: 30+ years of academic research on TEP fault detection
- **Detection Challenges**: Literature shows 20-98% detection rates depending on fault type and method
- **Gap in Chemical Context**: Existing methods focus on statistical patterns without chemical engineering understanding
- **Multi-LLM Opportunity**: Large Language Models can integrate chemical knowledge with pattern recognition

### User Context:
- **Process Engineers**: Need chemical context for fault understanding and response decisions
- **Control System Operators**: Require safety-prioritized alerts with clear explanations
- **Plant Managers**: Need economic impact assessment and optimization recommendations
- **Safety Personnel**: Require hazard-aware fault classification and emergency response guidance
