# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* To create a simple, clean, and accessible mobile-first experience for bidirectional language learning between English and Chinese.
* To provide an intuitive and uncluttered user interface using Chakra UI, focusing on the specific needs of learners in this language pair.
* To achieve 10,000 user sign-ups within the first six months.
* To maintain a first-month user retention rate above 40%.

## Background Context
While many language apps exist, there is a gap for learners focusing specifically on the English-Chinese language pair, particularly in a mobile-first environment. Existing tools can be overly complex, generic, or fail to address the unique challenges of learning Mandarin characters for English speakers or nuanced English grammar for Chinese speakers. LovingTree Lingo aims to solve this by providing a minimalist, streamlined application that prioritizes ease of use and a clear learning path, making the difficult task of learning English or Chinese more enjoyable and effective on the go.
