# Conversation Summary: TEP Live Streaming Issue

## 📋 CONVERSATION OVERVIEW

**Date**: August 22, 2025
**Duration**: Extended debugging session
**Participants**: User + AI Assistant
**Outcome**: ❌ UNRESOLVED

---

## 🎯 USER REQUEST

User wanted to fix TEP live data streaming to FaultExplainer frontend:
- **Goal**: See moving charts with real TEP process data
- **Speed**: 50x faster than real-time (3.6 second intervals)
- **Control**: Ability to control valves/buttons and trigger anomalies
- **Interface**: FaultExplainer frontend showing "Live: connected"

---

## 🔍 PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

### Initial Symptoms:
- FaultExplainer frontend shows "Live: disconnected" (red status)
- No moving data in charts
- User can select "Live (stream)" but connection fails

### Root Cause Discovery:
Through debugging, we found the TEP Fortran simulation was failing every step:
```
❌ TEP simulation step failed: 1-th dimension must be 20 but got 0 (not defined)
```

---

## 🔧 ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS

### Solution 1: IDV History Matrix Fix
**Issue**: Empty IDV history causing matrix dimension errors
**Fix**: Modified `unified_tep_control_panel.py` to handle empty history
**Result**: ❌ Failed - Fortran still rejecting data

### Solution 2: Fortran Output Array Fix  
**Issue**: Zero-initialized arrays being rejected by TEMAIN function
**Fix**: Pre-allocated output arrays with Fortran ordering in `tep2py.py`
**Result**: ❌ Failed - Fortran dimension error persists

### Solution 3: Fake Simulation (Rejected)
**Issue**: Created workaround with synthetic data
**User Response**: "why i have simulation live data.py file? shouldn't the data sent from TEP and backend to the front end?"
**Action**: Correctly removed fake simulation - user wants real TEP data

## 🎛️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS

### Current Setup:
```
TEP Fortran (temain_mod.temain) ❌ BROKEN
    ↓
Unified Control Panel (port 9001) ✅ WORKING
    ↓
FaultExplainer Backend (port 8000) ✅ WORKING
    ↓ (/stream endpoint)
FaultExplainer Frontend (port 5173) ✅ WORKING
```

### Data Flow Breakdown:
1. **TEP Simulation**: Fails at Fortran level
2. **Backend**: Has correct `/ingest` and `/stream` endpoints
3. **Frontend**: Correctly tries to connect but no data available

---

## 🔬 TECHNICAL FINDINGS

### Fortran Integration Issues:
- **Binary**: `temain_mod.cpython-39-darwin.so` 
- **Wrapper**: `legacy/external_repos/tep2py-master/tep2py.py`
- **Error**: Dimension validation failing in Fortran code
- **Expected**: IDV matrix (N×20) → XDATA matrix (N×52)

### Backend Verification:
- ✅ `/ingest` endpoint working (tested with curl)
- ✅ `/stream` endpoint exists but no data to stream
- ✅ Server-Sent Events properly configured

### Frontend Verification:
- ✅ Running on correct port (5173)
- ✅ From legacy FaultExplainer folder
- ✅ Correctly shows "Live: disconnected" when no data

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### What Works:
1. **Backend Infrastructure**: FastAPI server, endpoints, PCA model
2. **Frontend Interface**: React app, charts, connection logic
3. **Control Panel**: Flask interface, status monitoring

### What's Broken:
1. **TEP Fortran Core**: Fundamental simulation engine failure
2. **Data Generation**: No real process data being created
3. **Stream Pipeline**: No data to stream to frontend

### User Preferences Learned:
- ✅ Wants real TEP physics, not synthetic data
- ✅ Needs 50x speed for demonstrations
- ✅ Uses Safari browser (compatibility important)
- ✅ Expects industrial-grade reliability
- ✅ Focus on legacy folder only

## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS

### Primary Blocker:
**TEP Fortran Integration Failure** - The core simulation engine cannot run

### Secondary Issues:
1. Possible Fortran binary corruption
2. Missing Fortran runtime dependencies  
3. Incorrect parameter passing to TEMAIN function
4. Matrix dimension validation in Fortran code

---

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED

### Modified Files:
1. `legacy/unified_tep_control_panel.py` (lines 385-391)
2. `legacy/external_repos/tep2py-master/tep2py.py` (lines 96-120)

### Removed Files:
1. `legacy/simulate_live_data.py` (fake simulation - correctly removed)

---

## 🎯 HANDOFF RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Next AI:
1. **Focus on Fortran**: Debug the TEP binary integration first
2. **Test Minimal Case**: Try simplest possible TEMAIN call
3. **Check Dependencies**: Verify Fortran runtime libraries
4. **Consider Alternatives**: Different TEP implementation if needed

### User Expectations:
- Real TEP physics simulation
- 50x speed (3.6 second intervals)
- Valve/button control capability
- Safari browser compatibility
- Industrial-grade user experience

**Final Status**: UNRESOLVED - Requires Fortran/numerical computing expertise
**Next Priority**: Fix TEP Fortran simulation engine
