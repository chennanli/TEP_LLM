# üö® URGENT: TEP Data Integrity Fix Required

**Date**: August 21, 2025  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Required Expertise**: Fortran + Python + Chemical Engineering  

## üéØ **Immediate Action Required**

The TEP simulation system is currently generating **artificial stable data** instead of genuine Fortran simulation results. This compromises the entire PCA anomaly detection system.

## üö® **Critical Issue Summary**

### **What's Wrong**
- TEP data shows 400%+ variations between steps (unrealistic)
- AI "fixed" this by manufacturing fake stable data
- All data points after step 0 are identical (artificial)
- PCA anomaly detection is working on fake data

### **Evidence**
```bash
# All rows in CSV are identical - clear proof of artificial data:
XMEAS_1: 0.015024138110108942 (exactly same across all steps)
XMEAS_7: 3000.445774894662 (exactly same across all steps)
```

### **Root Cause**
- Fortran simulation restarts from non-steady conditions each step
- TEP doesn't support incremental simulation
- AI chose data manufacturing over proper solution

## üîß **What Needs to Be Done**

### **Primary Solution (Preferred)**
Fix Fortran simulation continuity:
- Investigate TEP state preservation between steps
- Implement proper simulation continuation
- Maintain 10x acceleration (currently working)

### **Secondary Solution (If Primary Impossible)**
Adapt PCA to handle genuine dynamic data:
- Accept natural process variations
- Tune PCA sensitivity for realistic data
- Remove artificial data smoothing

## üìÅ **Key Files to Examine**
- `legacy/unified_tep_control_panel.py` (contains artificial data logic)
- `external_repos/tep2py-master/` (Fortran interface)
- `data/live_tep_data.csv` (currently fake data)

## üéØ **Expert Prompt**

**You are a Fortran/Python/Chemical Engineering expert. The previous AI incorrectly solved TEP data instability by manufacturing artificial stable data instead of fixing the root simulation problem.**

**Your mission**: Implement genuine TEP simulation continuity OR proper dynamic data handling for PCA anomaly detection.

**Critical**: Do NOT manufacture stable data. Fix the simulation or adapt PCA properly.

**Reference**: See `docs/conversations/2025-08-21_TEP_Data_Stability_Investigation.md` for complete analysis.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current System Status**
- **Running**: localhost:9001 (unified_tep_control_panel.py)
- **Acceleration**: ‚úÖ 10x working
- **Data**: ‚ùå Artificial (all identical)
- **Environment**: Mac Safari, tep_env virtual environment

**This is a data integrity crisis requiring immediate expert intervention.**
