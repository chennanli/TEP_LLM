# 🎉 TEP FaultExplainer - Summary & Achievements

## 🏆 What We've Accomplished

### **✅ MAJOR ISSUES RESOLVED:**

#### **1. Anomaly Score Visualization - FIXED!**
- **Problem:** User couldn't see anomaly score or understand when AI analysis would trigger
- **Solution:** Added dedicated anomaly score plot with:
  - Time series visualization
  - Threshold line at 3.0
  - Color-coded zones (Green/Yellow/Red)
  - Real-time score display in status panel

#### **2. Stable Default Conditions - IMPLEMENTED!**
- **Problem:** System started with random values, confusing users
- **Solution:** System now starts in stable TEP operating conditions:
  - Temperature: 120°C (middle of 118-122°C range)
  - Pressure: 2.8 bar (middle of 2.7-2.9 bar range)
  - Flow: 45 kg/h (middle of 43-47 kg/h range)
  - Level: 67% (middle of 64-70% range)

#### **3. Control Explanations - ADDED!**
- **Problem:** No guidance on what controls do or when they trigger anomalies
- **Solution:** Comprehensive control guidance:
  - A/C Ratio: Normal (0.9-1.1), Caution (0.8-0.9, 1.1-1.3), Danger (<0.8, >1.3)
  - Fault descriptions for all 5 fault types
  - Expected effects and symptoms for each control
  - Visual color coding (green/yellow/red)

#### **4. JSON Serialization Bug - RESOLVED!**
- **Problem:** Status API returned 500 errors due to boolean serialization
- **Solution:** Proper type casting in status endpoint
- **Result:** Status panel now updates correctly without errors
