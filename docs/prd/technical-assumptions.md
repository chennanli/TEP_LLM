# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
A monorepo (a single repository for all code) is recommended to simplify development and code sharing.

## Service Architecture: Serverless/BaaS-driven
The architecture will be driven by a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform (e.g., Supabase) to accelerate MVP development.

## Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration
Our testing strategy for the MVP will focus on a combination of Unit tests and Integration tests.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
* The frontend will be built using **React** (likely with **Next.js**).
* **Chakra UI** will be the primary UI component library.
* The application will be deployed on a modern hosting platform like **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
* The curriculum content will be managed within the database of the chosen BaaS platform.
