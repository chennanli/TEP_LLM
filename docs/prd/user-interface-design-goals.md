# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience will be simple, encouraging, and free of distractions. The primary goal is to make learning feel like a gentle, guided activity, not a chore. The app will use positive reinforcement, clear progression, and a friendly tone to keep young learners engaged.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
Interactions will be designed for small hands on mobile devices. This includes large, easy-to-tap buttons and clear visual feedback for every action. Navigation will be simple, with a clear path back to the main dashboard at all times. Swiping and tapping will be the primary interaction methods.

## Core Screens and Views
* **Login/Welcome Screen**: A simple, friendly entry point to the app.
* **Main Dashboard**: The user's "home base," showing their current lesson, overall progress, and access to different learning modules.
* **Character Library**: A screen where users can browse the characters they can learn.
* **Lesson Screen**: The main learning interface where a character's stroke order, pinyin, and vocabulary are presented.
* **Practice/Test Screen**: The interactive quiz view for testing knowledge.
* **Settings Page**: For managing account details and preferences.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application will be designed to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards.

## Branding
The branding for "LovingTree Lingo" will be playful, soft, and encouraging. The visual design will utilize a color palette with soft, friendly colors, rounded shapes, and clean typography.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application will be built using a mobile-first, responsive web design.
