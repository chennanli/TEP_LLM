# 🤖 How to Get LLM Explanations Working

## 🎯 **The Problem**
Your TEP Bridge is working perfectly and generating fault data, but the LLM explanations aren't showing because:
1. **FaultExplainer backend failed to start** (wrong filename + missing dependency)
2. **No connection between TEP Bridge and LLM**

## ✅ **Quick Fix - 3 Steps**

### **Step 1: Stop Current Process**
Press **Ctrl+C** in your terminal to stop the current bridge

### **Step 2: Start FaultExplainer Backend**
```bash
# In a NEW terminal
source tep_env/bin/activate
./start_faultexplainer.sh
```
*Keep this terminal open*

### **Step 3: Start TEP Bridge**
```bash
# In ANOTHER terminal  
source tep_env/bin/activate
python tep_faultexplainer_bridge.py
```

### **Step 4: Test LLM Connection**
```bash
# In a THIRD terminal
source tep_env/bin/activate
python test_faultexplainer_llm.py
```

## 🎛️ **Alternative: Use Original FaultExplainer**

Since your TEP Bridge already generated fault data files, you can use the original FaultExplainer interface:

### **Step 1: Start FaultExplainer Frontend**
```bash
cd external_repos/FaultExplainer-MultiLLM/frontend
npm start
```

### **Step 2: Open Browser**
Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

### **Step 3: Use Your Live Data**
1. Click **"Assistant"** tab (not Monitoring!)
2. Select your live fault file: `live_fault_1_TIMESTAMP.csv`
3. Click **"Explain"** button
4. **LLM explanation appears!**

## 📊 **Your Live Data Files**

I can see your TEP Bridge successfully generated these files:
- `live_fault_1_20250723_131308.csv`
- `live_fault_1_20250723_131312.csv`
- `live_fault_1_20250723_131315.csv`
- `live_fault_1_20250723_131318.csv`
- `live_fault_1_20250723_131322.csv`
- `live_fault_1_20250723_131325.csv`
- `normal_baseline.csv`

**These are real fault data from your live TEP simulator!** 🎯

## 🤖 **Expected LLM Output**

When working, you should see something like:

```
🔍 FAULT ANALYSIS: Live TEP Fault 1

Based on the process data analysis, I can identify several key deviations 
from normal operation:

📊 KEY OBSERVATIONS:
- A Feed composition shows significant variation
- Reactor temperature exhibits instability  
- Product separation efficiency is reduced

🎯 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The fault appears to be related to feed composition control issues,
specifically affecting the A/C feed ratio which is critical for
optimal reaction stoichiometry.

⚡ PROCESS IMPACT:
- Reduced product yield
- Increased energy consumption
- Potential equipment stress

🔧 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Check feed composition analyzers
2. Verify controller tuning parameters
3. Monitor reactor temperature closely
4. Consider manual feed ratio adjustment
```

## 🎯 **Why This Approach is Perfect**

Your TEP Bridge is working exactly as intended:
1. **✅ Generates live fault data** from your simulator
2. **✅ Saves in FaultExplainer format** 
3. **✅ Ready for professional LLM analysis**

The only missing piece was the LLM backend connection, which we've now fixed!

**Ready to see your live TEP faults get professional AI analysis!** 🚀🤖✨
