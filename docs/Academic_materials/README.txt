DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
---------------------

#
# Directory of Files in Dataset: List and define the different 
# files included in the dataset. This serves as its table of 
# contents. 
#

Directory of Files: /matlab-release/csv
  A. Filename: TEP_test_xxxx_yyy_zz.csv
      Short description: A stored trace of a manipulated TEP execution: Component zz is manipulated with a pattern of xxxx and magnitude of yyy.

Directory of Files: /matlab-release/
  A. Filename: process_matlab_TEP.py
      Data processing file used to format the CSVs in this dataset. Included for reference.
  
  B. Filename: README.md
      Additional README file.

Additional Notes on File Relationships, Context, or Content 
(for example, if a user wants to reuse and/or cite your data, 
what information would you want them to know?):              

Data was generated with a publicly available simulator, located at: 
https://github.com/pwwl/tep-attack-simulator

#
# File Naming Convention: Define your File Naming Convention 
# (FNC), the framework used for naming your files systematically 
# to describe what they contain, which could be combined with the
# Directory of Files. 
#

File Naming Convention: 

Each manipulation is named with the following settings:
- Manipulation type: one of ['cons', 'csum', 'line']
- Manipulation magnitude: one of ['p2s', 'm2s', 'p3s', 'p5s']
- Manipulation location: sensors ['s1'] or actuators ['a1'], where the number corresponds to the feature number in the simulator

#
# Data Description: A data description, dictionary, or codebook
# defines the variables and abbreviations used in a dataset. This
# information can be included in the README file, in a separate 
# file, or as part of the data file. If it is in a separate file
# or in the data file, explain where this information is located
# and ensure that it is accessible without specialized software.
# (We recommend using plain text files or tabular plain text CSV
# files exported from spreadsheet software.)

DATA DESCRIPTION FOR: [FILENAME]
-----------------------------------------
<create sections for each dataset included>

1. Number of variables:

  Values for 53 components (41 sensors and 12 actuators) are included.
  The last (54th) column in each file contains the attack label: 1 if the manipulation is occurring, and 0 if not.

2. Number of cases/rows: 

  Each file contains 96001 timesteps. 

3. Missing data codes:
        Code/symbol        Definition
        Code/symbol        Definition

  N/A

4. Variable List

#
# Example. Name: Gender 
#     Description: Gender of respondent
#         1 = Male
#         2 = Female
#         3 = Transgender
#	      4 = Nonbinary
#		  5 = Other gender not listed 
#		  6 = Prefer not to answer
#

  Each variable is a component in the TEP process: 41 sensors and 12 actuators.
