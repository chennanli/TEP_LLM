- Explain the 52 sensor variables
- Show process temperatures, pressures, and flow rates
- Mention 3-minute update cycle

### **Fault Detection Demo (4 minutes)**
> "Now I'll demonstrate our fault detection capabilities."

**Actions**:
- Use fault injection controls in the dashboard
- Inject IDV1 fault with intensity 0.2-0.3
- Show real-time system response
- Explain how this simulates real plant disturbances
- Point out immediate system status changes

### **AI Diagnosis (2 minutes)**
> "When faults are detected, our AI system provides expert diagnosis."

**Show**:
- LLM analysis results
- Root cause identification
- Multiple AI perspectives (Claude + Gemini)

## 🛠️ **If Technical Issues Occur**

### **System Won't Start**
```bash
# Kill any existing processes
lsof -ti:9001 | xargs kill -9

# Restart system
cd legacy
python unified_tep_control_panel.py
```

### **Browser Issues**
- Use Safari (tested)
- Try Chrome as backup
- Clear browser cache if needed

### **Port Conflicts**
- System runs on port 9001
- If busy, kill process: `lsof -ti:9001 | xargs kill -9`
